;;TODO - why does this happen? Occasionally, CMD-c will insert a ¢ character,
;;and C-h k CMD-c shows this:
;;		¢ (translated from A-c) runs the command self-insert-command, which is
;;		an interactive built-in function in `C source code'.
;;			
;;		It is bound to many ordinary text characters.
;;			
;;		(self-insert-command N)
;;			
;;		Insert the character you type.
;;		Whichever character you type to run this command is inserted.
;;		Before insertion, `expand-abbrev' is executed if the inserted character does
;;		not have word syntax and the previous character in the buffer does.
;;		After insertion, the value of `auto-fill-function' is called if the
;;		`auto-fill-chars' table has a non-nil value for the inserted character.

;;Temporary solution, I guess, is to re-bind it to 
;;clipboard-kill-ring-save
